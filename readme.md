# MarkdownGitWiki

The Project is aimed at "small" to "mid-sized" documentation projects.

The goals are:

* Easy **Setup** - Just create folders and text files in your file system.
* Easy **Modification** - Edit with your favourite word processor, text editor, IDE, online...
* Easy **Collaboration** - The text files can be put under version control and published to a public VCS server (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com))
* Easy **Deployment** - MarkdownGitWiki is an extension for the [Joomla! CMS](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms).

As you might notice, the name consists in three parts:

## Markdown

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML.

* <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/> The "original Markdown"
* <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/> The "extended syntax" we are based on with our extension..

## Git

Git is not part of this project, nor is it required to make it work.

It is just one possible version control system, if you plan to put your work under version control. You might also use SVN, bazaar etc.

But if you use Git, the MarkdownGitWiki extension might offer you some aids.

## Wiki

Well, it's like a Wiki...

# How does it Work ?

The idea is to put your text documents into text files, written in Markup syntax. Nicely organized into folders that will form the (browsable) structure of your documentation.

Create (nested) folders and text files using the extension ```md``` for markdown (e.g. ```Pagetitle.md```).

Specify the path to your "document folder" in the extension configuration in the Joomla! backend and...

**Enjoy!**
